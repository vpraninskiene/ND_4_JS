    <h2>Earth is not a perfect sphere</h2>
    <p>Yes, we've all been taught that the Earth is not flat, but it may shock you to learn that it's not perfectly spherical either. Earth spins while gravity pushes toward the center and a centrifugal force, perpendicular to Earth's axis, pushes out. This results in a bit of a tilted shape—not a perfect sphere.</p>

    <h2>The sun makes up 99.8% of the solar system's mass</h2>
    <p>The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8% of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth — about one million Earths could fit inside the sun.</p>

    <h2>Milky Way has tens of thousands of black holes</h2>
    <p>Black holes are impossible to detect on their own because light can't escape from them. But when paired with a star, they interact in a way that allows scientists to find them using X-rays. The study posits that the center of the Milky Way contains hundreds of black holes paired with stars and 10,000 isolated black holes.</p>
